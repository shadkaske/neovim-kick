# Personal Neovim Config

Based of the [Kickstart Nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) configuration. Plugins have been separted into individual files in lua/plugins with configurations included.

Using the [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager, but I don't lazy load most of the bits. Because really, does hours of troubleshooting an issue really make up for a few milliseconds saved when loading the appliction? ( no, no it does not )

I would list the plugins here, but I just don't give a shit. They are listed in the lua/plugins folder. Want to change something? Change it there.

Don't like an options setting? Change it in the lua/config/options.lua file.

Hate a keybind choice? Change it in the lua/config/keymaps.lua file.

Do you have a deep hatred for a plugin choice? I don't care. Use something else.
